This is an ambitious, massive formalization project to record all the intermediate mathematics between Mathlib and Fermat's Last Theorem.
* Commit as you go. Use Conventional Commits-ish style.
* Keep the dependency graph chronological: each chapter may import only earlier chapters in the same book and chapters from earlier books. Never import a later chapter or a chapter from a later book.
* Codex: use timeouts of at least 30 minutes for `wait`, `wait_agent`, and `write_stdin`.
* Formalization tasks, review tasks, and proof-review statements should emphasize building chains of lemmas. The goal is not merely to prove the final named theorem, but to record the reusable intermediate mathematics that makes the argument understandable and useful downstream.

## Lean guidelines

1. **Build explicit chains of lemmas.** Introduce many well-named intermediate lemmas that each capture one mathematical step, including results that may be useful beyond the immediate proof. Prefer a sequence of reusable declarations over a single monolithic proof of the headline theorem. Formalization plans and reviews should identify missing links in these chains and propose or request concrete lemma statements.
2. **Keep declarations small.** Break long proofs into helper lemmas with explicit statements. This gives Lean smaller elaboration problems and avoids repeatedly re-inferring large intermediate terms.
3. **Add type annotations to important intermediate terms.** Prefer `have h : T := ...` over `have h := ...` when `T` is nontrivial. Explicit types reduce metavariable creation and constrain elaboration early.
4. **Do not rely on expensive definitional equality.** If two complicated expressions are mathematically the same but only become identical after unfolding, use an explicit lemma or rewrite to connect them instead of making Lean discover this automatically.
5. **Avoid unfolding large definitions in downstream proofs.** Prove simple API lemmas about a definition once—e.g. application, membership, equality, map, or simp lemmas—and reason through those instead of repeatedly using `simp [BigDefinition]` or `unfold BigDefinition`.
6. **Control `simp` on large expressions.** If a proof is slow, prefer `simp only [lemma1, lemma2, ...]` or perform the key rewrite explicitly before simplifying. Broad `simp` can repeatedly traverse and rewrite very large terms.
7. **Avoid repeated typeclass search.** If Lean repeatedly needs the same complicated instance, construct or select it once with `letI`/`haveI` and reuse it. Failed or ambiguous instance searches can be especially expensive.
8. **Name large repeated expressions.** If the same large sum, map, subtype, structure expression, etc. appears repeatedly, bind it with `let`, `set`, or a helper definition rather than elaborating and comparing the full expression everywhere.
9. **Do not fix slow proofs by increasing `maxHeartbeats`.** A declaration taking seconds usually indicates excessive inference, unfolding, simplification, or automation. Change the proof structure instead of merely allowing more work.
10. **Treat unexpectedly slow declarations as bugs.** Ordinary lemmas should generally elaborate in well under a second; investigate multi-second declarations before building more code on top of them.
11. **Use automation to discover proofs, then specialize it if it is slow.** You can start with a temporary aesop, grind, simp, linarith, etc. If it works, use the corresponding suggestion tactic (aesop?, grind?, simp?, linarith?, exact?, apply?, rw?) and replace broad search with the suggested lemmas/tactics or a smaller ... only [...] invocation.

## Lint hygiene

Write proofs so they pass the default Mathlib linters: bind instances with `let`/`have` (not `letI`/`haveI`) whenever the bound statement is a Prop or the value need not be inlined, and use plain `simp` rather than `simpa` when simplification alone closes the goal; also drop unused simp arguments and prefix unused binder names with `_`.
